```

```{r}
z<-params$z
z_rounded<-as.numeric(round_and_format_z(z))
parts <- extract_tenths_and_hundredths(z)
u <- parts[1]
h <- parts[2]
a <- round(pnorm(z_rounded),4)
nearestPercent <- round(a*100)
```

Just some text to practice this

```{r}
huxdf<-make_z_huxtable(z, 2)
huxdf<-highlight_z_lookup(huxdf, z) 
```
