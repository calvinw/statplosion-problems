```{r}
library("statplosion")
```

```{r}
z<-params$z
z_rounded<-as.numeric(round_and_format_z(z))
parts <- extract_tenths_and_hundredths(z)
u <- parts[1]
h <- parts[2]
a <- round(pnorm(z_rounded),4)
nearestPercent <- round(a*100)
```

We have $z=`r z`$.

Below is a picture of the area. We want to know how big the shaded area is. In particular if the whole area under the curve is 100%, how big is the shaded part? 

```{r fig.height=2, fig.width=3, fig.align="center"}
std_normal_curve()
std_normal_shade_left_area(z)
std_normal_label_point(z)
```

We start by going to the row that has $z=`r u`$ and then we go over to the column that is $`r h`$. The left tail area is where the row and column meet. 

```{r}
make_highlighted_z_huxtable(z,3)
```

So we have this:
$$
\text{left tail area} =`r a`
$$

Rounded to the nearest percent this is $`r nearestPercent`$%. The shaded region represents about $`r nearestPercent`$% of the entire area.
